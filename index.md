## Processing of macroinvertebrates sampling

### Theoretical background

To asses the water quality physicochemical, hydrological and biological characteristics have to be studied. Macroinvertebrates show in a comprehensive manner all of them, reason why their study is included in the European Water Framework Directive and used as a main tool to understand the status of a water body for decades.

### Functionality of the program

The relevance of processing the results of macroinvertebrates sampling sites is the motivation for this project. The aim is to compare two excel files, one containing data from relevant previous macroinvertebrates sampling and the results from the current sampling (specifically whe the Kick sampling method is used). To fulfill that aim, the program s devided into 5 steps:
 1. The program will read the data given by the user
(*Sample data* and *Data base*, *mesh* and *criteria*)
 2. The percetage of each organism in *Data base* is computed.
 3. Then, using the *Sample Data* and the size of the *mesh*, 
 4. the amount of macroorganisms per area will be calculated 
along with the percentage of each.
 5. A comparaison of the percentage of each organism found in 
the site (*Sample data*) with the percentage of the organisms
shown in previous studies (*Data base*) will be made
 6. Using the *criteria* defined, the organisms under and 
above of it will be shown in a bar-graph.

### Results

1. **Results_Final.jpg**: a jpg file that is the final graph showing the
percentage of the *Data base* in <span style="color: blue"> blue</span>,
the *Sampling data* in <span style="color: orange"> orange</span>, and
the difference between both in <span style="color: green"> green</span>.
2. **Results_Final.xlsx**: an Excel file that shows the graph described
in 1 and a table that contains the species name, the amount and percentage of
each specie in the sample and the data and the difference between both. In this
last column the numbers in <span style="color: red"> red</span> mean they are
below the criteria stated in the input. Also colored in 
`<span style="color: yellow"> yellow</span>` will be the rows in which there is no
data to compare between the *Data base* and the *Sample data*
3. **Results_Final.pdf**: a pdf file that shows the same information as in point 2.
